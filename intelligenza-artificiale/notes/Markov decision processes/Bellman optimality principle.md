The Bellman optimality principle is a central concept in dynamic programming, which is a mathematical optimization method used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, easier-to-solve subproblems. The principle states that the optimal decision at any point in time should be based on the optimal decision from all previous states, as well as the current state. This means that the optimal solution to a problem can be found by working backwards from the final state, using the principles of optimality to determine the best decisions at each step along the way. This approach can be used to solve a wide variety of optimization problems, including those involving time-dependent processes, such as planning and control in artificial intelligence.
