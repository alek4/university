The **Markov property** is a fundamental concept in the theory of Markov processes, which are stochastic processes that have the property that the future is independent of the past given the present. In other words, the future behavior of a Markov process is determined solely by its current state and not by its past history.

The Markov property is named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov, who first formulated it in the early 1900s. It is a key property of Markov processes and is used in the study of a wide range of systems, including random walks, queueing systems, and biological systems.

The Markov property is often stated as follows:

```
"The future is independent of the past given the present"
```

In other words, if we know the current state of a Markov process, then we can predict its future behavior without knowing anything about its past. This property allows us to model complex systems using relatively simple mathematical models.

In general, the Markov property is a useful tool for modeling systems in which the future depends only on the current state and not on the past. It is often used in the study of stochastic processes, which are processes that involve randomness or uncertainty.
