In a Markov decision process (MDP), a **policy** is a process that determines what action to take in a given state. It is a mapping from states to actions, indicating what action the agent should take in each state. In other words, a policy defines the behavior of an agent in an MDP.

A policy are deterministic, where it specifies a unique action to take in each state. The goal of an MDP is to find an optimal policy that maximizes some notion of long-term reward. This is typically done using reinforcement learning algorithms, which iteratively improve the policy by learning from the consequences of the actions taken under the current policy.

Policies in MDPs are typically evaluated using the notion of value, which is a measure of how good a given state is for an agent following a particular policy. The value of a state under a policy is the expected long-term reward that the agent will receive if it starts in that state and follows the policy thereafter. The value of a state can be calculated using a dynamic programming algorithm, such as value iteration or policy iteration.

Overall, policies play a key role in MDPs, as they determine the behavior of the agent and can be used to evaluate the performance of the agent in a given environment.
